Using VSCode making a page look like the google homepage, with own tweaks and quirks.
Testing out knowledge of git, HTML and CSS.


Quite a few things I thought I knew but didn't, very steep learning curve with this seemingly simple project. did spend some time trying to perfect it (for my monitor and browser). I'd say it seems semi-responsive as when I reduce screen size but defiently still more to implement to correct all that.
    
I did have to inspect a few elements to get the correct color scheme for the buttons. I don't consider that a bad thing just a time saver and it didn't have to be perfect anyway.

Still missing the magnifying glass from the searchbar input and missing the country in the footer.

Other than all that I'd say I have done a great job and have learnt a lot in this process which shall make my next project a tad easier hopefully (see: google-resultspage).
